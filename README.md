# aws-docker-challenge


Read through the following and get back to us with any questions you might have, and a rough
time estimate on when you think you will be able to complete the challenge.

Using the ​AWS free tier​, create an account to accomplish the following tasks.
1. Using ​[Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)​ create a new [​Ubuntu 18.04](https://ubuntu.com/)​ ​[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)​ instance and expose port 80 on
a public IP address.
2. On the EC2 instance, using ​[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)​, install ​[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)​ and start a ​[Nginx Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
that is running version 1.17.6 on port 80.
a. We should be able to connect to this web server from anywhere on the public
internet.
3. Create a ​[GitHub](https://github.com/)​ repo and put all of your code (CloudFormation, Ansible config, etc) in
this repo, with a ​README.md file that contains your documentation explaining how to
use the code in the repo for installing the server.
4. When complete, send the server IP address along with the link to the GitHub repo to
Ken.Cochrane@wexinc.com​ and ​Jered.Philippon@wexin.com

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Ken or Jered.
